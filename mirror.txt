Source Mirrors
==============

OE-lite provides means for setting up and maintaining mirrors of external
sources used in builds.

This is useful for ensuring that OE-lite builds are not affected by 3rd party
sources being removed from their original location on the Internet.  It can
also be used for redirecting all fetches from the Internet to a local server
(or filesystem), making OE-lite work in closed networks or without any network
connection at all.


Prerequisites
-------------

To setup an OE-lite source mirror, you must use OE-lite/core 3.2.0 or newer.

The filesystem path to the source mirror must be specified, fx. in your
+local.conf+ file.  Fx.

----
MIRRORDIR = "/local/mirror"
----


The mirror class
----------------

An OE-lite source mirror is both created and maintained with the help of the
OE-lite +mirror+ task.  The +mirror+ task will add any sources required by the
recipe which is not already present in the mirror, and will fail if a file
conflict occurs.

There is also an +mirrorall+ task, which recursively causes the +mirror+ task
to be run for all recipes that the recipe depends on (both build and run-time
dependencies).

The +mirror+ and +mirrorall+ tasks are implemented in the
+classes/mirror.oeclass+ file in OE-lite/core.

The +MIRRORDIR+ directory will be created if it does not exist.


Creating and maintaining a source mirror
----------------------------------------

As the source mirror is maintained with the help of the +mirror+ and
+mirrorall+ tasks, you need to configure your +local.conf+ for the +MACHINE+
and +SDK+ configuration options required for your mirror.

For each configuration, you must run the +mirrorall+ task on the required
top-level recipes (or world or universe, if you want really everything in your
mirror).

Fx.

[source,sh]
----
oe bake -t mirrorall kernel my-rootfs my-sdk
----

or

[source,sh]
----
oe bake -t mirrorall universe
----

After having run this on all the required configurations, your source mirror
in +MIRRORDIR+ will be up-to-date with all sources required for the current
OE-lite checkout and the configurations used.


Synchronizing mirror directory to remote server
-----------------------------------------------

The mirror will be created (and maintained) in a directory on the machine
running OE-lite.  To maintain a mirror on a remote server, you could use the
rsync command (requires ssh login access to server, and rsync command on the
server):

The following command will synchronize the /local/mirror directory to the
/mirror directory on the server (myserver):

[source,sh]
----
rsync -av /local/mirror/ myserver:/mirror/
----

Build from source mirror
------------------------

To use the OE-lite source mirror, the +MIRRORS+ and +PREMIRRORS+ variables
must be modified.

If you only want to fall-back to using the source mirror, and thus always try
to fetch from the original source first, you should change the +MIRRORS+
variable to something like

----
MIRRORS = """
http://.*/ http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/
ftp://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/
git://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/git//
svn://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/svn//
"""
----

If you want to use the source mirror first, and only fall-back to trying the
orignial source in case fetching from the source mirror fails, you should
change the +PREMIRRORS+ variable to something like

----
PREMIRRORS = """
http://.*/ http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/
ftp://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/
git://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/git//
svn://.*/  http://myserver/mirror/${INGREDIENTS_SUBDIR}/svn//
"""
----

Both of the configurations above assumes that your "myserver" is running an
HTTP server, and is hosting the +/mirror+ directory on the
http://myserver/mirror URL.

If you only want to allow fetching from the source mirror, and thus forbid
fetching from any other remote server, you can use the +URL_WHITELIST+
variable.  In addition to the +MIRRORS+ and/or +PREMIRRORS+ variables, you
could add something like

----
URL_WHITELIST = "http://myserver/mirror"
----
