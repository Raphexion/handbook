Working with Upstream
=====================

This chapter describes how to work with the upstream OE-lite.org project.


Mailing Lists
-------------

Development and coordination of the OE-lite.org project is managed on the
+++dev@oe-lite.org+++ mailing list.

Use this for getting in contact with OE-lite.org developers and discussion or
coordination of OE-lite development.

Subscribing
~~~~~~~~~~~

To subscribe, you can either use the web interface or the email interface.

.Using the web interface

. Go to the list information page
  (http://lists.oe-lite.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

. Look for the section marked "Subscribing to dev" and fill in the boxes. You
  can fill in the following:

  * You must enter your email address.

  * You may choose to supply your real name.

  * You may choose a password. If you do not choose one, Mailman will generate
    one for you.  WARNING: Do NOT use a valuable password, since this password
    may be mailed to you in plain text.

  * If the list supports more than one language, you may be able to choose
    your preferred language.  NOTE: This setting does not affect posts to the
    list, only pre-prepared Mailman texts such as your member options page.

. Press the subscribe button. A new page should appear telling you that your
  request has been sent.

.Using the email interface

. Open a mail program which sends mail from the address you want to subscribe.

. Send a mail to dev-join@oe-lite.org. The subject and body of the message
  will be ignored, so it doesn't matter what you put there.

You may receive an email message asking for confirmation that you really want
to be subscribed to the list. This is to prevent anyone from subscribing you
to lists without your permission. Follow the instructions given in the message
to confirm your wish to be subscribed.

Once this is done, you will receive another message welcoming you to the
list. This message contains some useful information including your list
password and some quick links for changing your options, so you may want to
save it for later reference.

Unsubscribing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to leave the list, there are two common ways you can unsubscribe.

.Using the web interface

. Go to the list information page
  (http://lists.oe-lite.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

. Look for the section marked "dev subscribers" (near the bottom of the page).

. There should be a button marked "Unsubscribe or Edit Options." Enter your
  email address in the box beside this button and press the button.

. You should be brought to a new page which has an "Unsubscribe" button. Press
  it to unsubscribe and follow the instructions given.

.Using the email interface

. Open a mail program which sends mail from the address you want to
  unsubscribe.

. Send a mail to dev-leave@oe-lite.org.  The subject and body of this message
  will be ignored, so it doesn't matter what you put there.


LogMessagePolicy
----------------

The following guidelines should be followed when writing log messages for
commits to be included in OE-lite.org repositories:

* The first line should be a short description, prefixed what is being changed.

** The prefix should be one of

*** Name of subdir containing recipes, fx. 'linux', for changes to recipes
    within that directory.

*** Name of recipe, fx. 'linux-yocto', for changes to that specific recipe.

*** Name of OE-lite class (.bbclass file) prefixed with 'class',
    fx. 'class/cross', for changes to that specific class.

*** Name of distro configuration file prefixed with 'distro/',
    fx. 'distro/base', for changes to that distro configuration.

*** Name of machine configuraton file prefixed with 'machine/',
    fx. 'machine/beagleboard', for changes to that machine configuration.

*** Name of subdir containing Python library code prefixed with 'lib/',
    fx. 'lib/oelite', for changes to Python files in that dir.

*** Name of configuration file (in conf/ directory) prefixed with 'conf/',
    fx. 'conf/package', for changes to that file (package.conf).

** The description should be very short (a few words), summarising the change.

** The prefix and description is separated by a space followed by a colon
   (ie. ': ').

* The first line should be followed by an empty line

* Additional lines, may follow describing more details of the change.

* The details if feasible, should be structured as a list, with each item
  marked with a start '*',

* Signed-off-by (SOB) lines are currently not required in OE-lite.

* Lines must not be longer than 75 characters.

The first line of commit log messages are very important, as it in some cases
will be the the only description of the change being presented, fx.  in
subject lines of mails being created with git-format-patch.

These guidelines should be followed, but may be combined with common sense for
doing things different when it makes sense.

.Example: Adding a recipe named dhcp3
----
dhcp3: New recipe, for ISC DHCP version 3

In the newer versions of dhcp (4.X), bind is included statically linked in
dhcp, making some dhcp files unneccessary big.  Therefore, an older version
of dhcp is often desired.
----


Submitting Changes
------------------

When making changes to OE-lite metadata layers originating from OE-lite.org,
you should make an effort to get your changes merged to OE-lite.org.  By doing
this, you will reduce future maintenance effort, as you don't have to take
care with maintaining that particular change/feature anymore.

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development model used for the OE-lite.org project is a pull model.  Each
repository on OE-lite.org has a single developer with push access, ie. the
maintainer.  Only the maintainer is allowed to push changes to the respective
repository.

To get changes into an OE-lite.org repository where you are not the
maintainer, you have to make a pull request.  A pull request is an email, or
most often a series of emails, to +++dev@oe-lite.org+++ containing the entire
change set that is proposed together with a description of the change,
additional information, and everything in a form so that it can easily be
integrated with the git SCM tool.

The pull request can then be reviewed by other OE-lite.org developers,
including the maintainer, and everyone has the possibility to make comments,
and propose improvements to the change set.  The maintainer might then decide
to pull in the pull request as it is, or ask the submitter to rework the
change set according and resubmit it when done, where the process restarts.

Preparing a Patch Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a patch set for sending to dev@oe-lite.org, you can use the
create-pull-request script in OE-lite/core (in the scripts directory).

Let's say you have a couple of commits in your local "my-branch" branch, which
you have pushed to the "my-gitorious" remote, which is your OE-lite/base clone
on gitorious.org.  Your "my-branch" branch is relative to the "master" branch
of the "upstream" remote (git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/base.git).  In this case,
you can prepare the patch set with the following command:

[source,sh]
----
../core/scripts/create-pull-request -u my-gitorious -b my-branch \
	-r upstream/master -i my-branch
----

As the script also will remind you, you will then have to edit a file with the
cover e-mail with a proper description of your patch set.


Sending a Patch Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you should make sure that git send-email is properly configured.  You
can fx. set your email address with something like this:

[source,sh]
----
git config --global sendemail.from your.name@gmail.com
----

You know have a patch set in something like a pull-1234 directory of your
meta/base subdirectory.  To send that, you can use the send-pull-request
script to send to dev@oe-lite.org:

[source,sh]
----
../core/scripts/send-pull-request -a -p pull-1234 -t dev@oe-lite.org
----

For this to work, you need to have your host machine configured to be able to
send e-mail, so that git send-email is able to send mails to the
+++dev@oe-lite.org+++ list.  The details for how to do this depends very much
on your host system setup, and is not covered in this handbook.
