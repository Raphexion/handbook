Release Management
==================

This chapter covers the various aspects related to making releases of OE-lite
based projects.

Some parts of this chapter is meant as a guideline and not something that you
need to follow.


Metadata Versioning
-------------------

For OE-lite.org metadata projects, the releases must be versioned according to
the scheme described in this section.

OE-lite.org metadata releases must follow the Semantic Versioning
specification (see http://semver.org).  Briefly described, this means that
version numbers are formatted as X.Y.X, with X being major number, Y being
minor number, and Z being patch number.

For releases that only contains backwards compatible bugfixes (a bugfix
release) should be versioned with an increment to the patch number.  A bugfix
release based on X.Y.Z would thus be X.Y.Z+1.

For release that contains new, backwards compatible functionality (minor
releases) should be versioned with an increment to the minor number.  A minor
release based on X.Y.Z would thus be X.Y+1.0.

For releases that contains any backwards incompatile changes (major releases)
should be versioned with an increment to the major number.  A major release
based on X.Y.Z would thus be X+1.0.0.

For more details, see http://semver.org


BSP Versioning
--------------

For OE-lite.org BSP projects, the releases must be versioned according to the
scheme described in this section.

An OE-lite.org BSP is specified by a version number, and an optional release
name.  Notice that the version number is mandatory and must by itself specify
the release.  The release name is optional and only meant as a possibility of
adding a short description (or perhaps for adding a funny name...).

Currently, there is no rules or guidelines for the numbering scheme.
Suggestions and discussion related to this are welcome at dev@oe-lite.org :-)


Branching and Tagging
---------------------

TBD...
