Release Management
==================

This chapter covers the various aspects related to making releases of OE-lite
based projects.

Some parts of this chapter is meant as a guideline and not something that you
need to follow.


Metadata Releases
-----------------

This section describes how to make releases of OE-lite metadata projects (like
OE-lite/core, OE-lite/base and so on).


Metadata Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For OE-lite.org metadata projects, the releases must be versioned according to
the scheme described in this section.

OE-lite.org metadata releases must follow the Semantic Versioning
specification (see http://semver.org).  Briefly described, this means that
version numbers are formatted as X.Y.X, with X being major number, Y being
minor number, and Z being patch number.

For releases that only contains backwards compatible bugfixes (a bugfix
release) should be versioned with an increment to the patch number.  A bugfix
release based on X.Y.Z would thus be X.Y.Z+1.

For release that contains new, backwards compatible functionality (feature
releases) should be versioned with an increment to the minor number.  A
feature release based on X.Y.Z would thus be X.Y+1.0.

For releases that contains any backwards incompatile changes (major releases)
should be versioned with an increment to the major number.  A major release
based on X.Y.Z would thus be X+1.0.0.

For more details, see http://semver.org


[[metadata-release-branching]]
Metadata Release Branching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OE-lite.org metadata releases should be done from a release branch named X.Y
(for release version X.Y.Z).

When creating a new major release, a new release branch must be created.  This
new X.0 branch should branch off of either the previous latest release branch
(ie. X-1.Y) or the master branch.

When creating a new feature release, a new release branch must be created.
This new X.Y branch should branch off of the previous release branch (X.Y-1).

When creating a new bugfix release, the X.Y release branch should already
exist.  It should have been created when the X.Y.0 feature release (or major
release if Y=0) was made.

Release branchs must be pushed to the official OE-lite.org upstream repository
(ie. git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/core.git for OE-lite/core).  Release branches
are considered permanent branches, and should not be deleted, as they must be
available for doing bugfix releases from.

IMPORTANT: Public release branches must not be rebased, or the commit history
           in any other way be rewritten.


[[metadata-release-tagging]]
Metadata Release Tagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a release is ready to go out of the door, it must be tagged.

OE-lite.org metadata project releases must contain a +VERSION+ file containing
the release version number in plain text.  So before making the git tag, a new
commit with this file should be created.

The following example shows how to create a release commit and tag:

[source,sh]
-----------
echo "3.4.1" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "Release 3.4.1"
git tag -a -m "Release 3.4.1" v3.4.1
-----------

After the release is done, the +VERSION+ file should be removed, so that only
the actual release version carries it.

[source,sh]
-----------
git rm VERSION
git commit -m "Unrelease"
-----------

The release branch (including both the release and unrelease commit) and the
release tag must of-course be pushed to the official OE-lite.org upstream
repository (ie. git://oe-lite.org/oe-lite/core.git for OE-lite/core).

IMPORTANT: Release tags must not be changed.

NOTE: The release and unrelease commits does not need a Signed-off-by line.


Metadata Release Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OE-lite.org metadata project releases must be available as tarball for
download on http://oe-lite.org/download/

To create release tarballs, use something like the following:

[source,sh]
-----------
git archive --prefix=core-3.4.1/ -o oe-lite-core-3.4.1.tar v3.4.1
cat oe-lite-core-3.4.1.tar | gzip > oe-lite-core-3.4.1.tar.gz
cat oe-lite-core-3.4.1.tar | xz > oe-lite-core-3.4.1.tar.xz
-----------

To put the tarballs on oe-lite.org, stuff them somewhere on the net and send
an email to esben@haabendal.dk (with cc to dev@oe-lite.org) requesting copies
to be placed on the oe-lite.org server.


Metadata Release Announcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the OE-lite.org metadata project release is ready (ie. tarballs are on
oe-lite.org, and the release has been pushed to the official oe-lite.org
repository, the release must be announced to the OE-lite.org community.

The release must be announced both on the dev@oe-lite.org mailing list and the
http://oe-lite.org site.

Metadata Release Email Announcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The release announcement email could look something like
http://lists.oe-lite.org/pipermail/dev/2012-November/001222.html.

To generate the contributer contribution and the per-author shortlog text, you
can use the http://oe-lite.org/download/scripts/release-mail.py script.  It
should be called like this:

[source,sh]
-----------
release-mail.py v3.4.0 v3.4.0
-----------

With the first argument specifying the release you are announcing, and the
second argument specifying the release that it is based on.

Metadata Relase Redmine Announcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To announce the release on http://oe-lite.org, you must create a Redmine news
item, and it could look something like http://oe-lite.org/redmine/news/11.


Metadata Release Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Is the release created from a release branch according to the
   description in section xref:metadata-release-branching[Metadata Release
   Branching]?

2. Is the release properly tagged according to the description in section
   xref:metadata-release-tagging[Metadata Release Tagging]?

3. Has tar-balls been created and uploaded to oe-lite.org according to the
   description in section xref:metadata-release-tarballs[Metadata Release
   Tarballs]?

4. Has a release announcement mail been sent to the dev@oe-lite.org
   mailinglist according to the description in
   xref:metadata-release-announcement[Metadata Release Announcment]?

5. Has the http://oe-lite.org Redmine been updated with a News item according
   to the description in xref:metadata-release-announcement[Metadata Release
   Announcment]?


BSP Versioning
--------------

For OE-lite.org BSP projects, the releases must be versioned according to the
scheme described in this section.

An OE-lite.org BSP is specified by a version number, and an optional release
name.  Notice that the version number is mandatory and must by itself specify
the release.  The release name is optional and only meant as a possibility of
adding a short description (or perhaps for adding a funny name...).

Currently, there is no rules or guidelines for the numbering scheme.
Suggestions and discussion related to this are welcome at dev@oe-lite.org :-)


Branching and Tagging
---------------------

TBD...
